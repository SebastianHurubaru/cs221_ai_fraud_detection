THE BIRTH OF QUANTUS
Previous leaks of financial data from the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers reveal that Quantus is owned by Panama-based Cascado AG.

That company, itself shrouded in secrecy, is managed by a slew of Latvian proxies, including Stan Gorin and Erik Vanagels â€” two names reportedly connected to multiple corruption scandals.

The connection appears in an Aug. 23, 2006 email in which an IOS Group employee asks a representative of another formation agent, the British Virgin Islands-based Commonwealth Trust Ltd., to incorporate Quantus and 29 other offshore companies. The IOS representative specifically requests that they all be owned by Cascado.
